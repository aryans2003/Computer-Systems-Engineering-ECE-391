Bugs for CP1

Bug #1 - Aryan, paging

Date: 03/18/2024
Problem: Not handling bits properly
Fix: Read through documentation for the offsets in paging.h for memory bits, changed to 22 (4MB) and 12(4KB). Also checking to make sure that different addresses are being set properly.

Bug #2 - Aryan, paging

Date: 03/18/2024
Problem: Control Registers not updating properly
Fix: Include '$' before hex value

Bug #3 - Aryan and Kushal, paging

Date: 03/19/2024
Problem: Boot Loop
Fix: Initially a TA told us that it was our ASM code, however our C code for setting the struct values in paging.c were not correct. We had to read through documentation and fix it accordingly.

Bug #4 - Aryan, paging

Date: 03/18/2024
Problem: Syntax error when initializing page directory in paging.h
Fix: Ended up not being a syntax error at that line itself, but when defining the typset the declaration after brackets was wrong

Bug #5 - Aryan and Kushal, paging

Date: 03/19/2024
Problem: Struct issues in paging.h
Fix: Had to abandon a method in which we defined 2 structs for 4KB and 4MB separately, made them into a union, and then only defined 1 PDE to be used when defining struct values in paging.C
Instead, we combined the structs into 1 typedef and then combined the values since they are all 32-bits anyways. We created 1 PDE variable and 2 PTEs for manipulation in paging.c

Bug #6 - Aryan and Kushal, paging

Date: 03/19/2024
Problem: Boot Loop
Fix: Accessing the first 4KB page at the 0th index within an entire loop from 0 to the 1024 4-byte entries will cause paging to boot loop.

Bugs for CP2

Bug #7 - Aryan, Pranav, Riyaan, filesystem
Problem: Displaying files for read_dentry_by_index
Fix: We had to look inside the fsdir files to see how many files we wanted and kept changing our loop maximum value until we saw all the files we needed.

Bug #8 - Aryan, Pranav, filesystem
Problem: Calculating index for read_directory
Fix: We defined a global variable for file_count, and incremented it each time a filename was copied to our buffer. This variable was passed into our read_dentry_by_index call in read_directory

Bug # 9 - Aryan, Pranav, filesystem
Problem: Utilizing proper stdlib functions
Fix: Being aware of the different file types used and when to use functions such as strcmp, strncpy, memcpy instead of arithmetic comparisons in C

Bug # 10 - Aryan, Pranav, filesystem
Problem: Extra smiley face ASCII char printed at the end of "verylargetextwithverylongname.txt"
Fix: At first, I thought we had to subtract one from the length value we used for strcpy. When that took out both the x and the smiley face, we knew it was wrong. Instead, using putc instead of a printf got rid of the formatting errors.

Bug # 11 - Kushal, RTC
Problem: For the RTC write function I tried doing a function that would convert the passed in frequencies to match an index on the 
array I created. This wasn't changing the frequencies as expected and would remain at the default 2 Hz frequency.
Fix: I made a switch statement instead to convert the frequencies to the right index on the frequency array to manage each frquency.

Bug # 12 - Kushal, keyboard
Problem: The backspace key would fill up the keyboard buffer and not allow us to enter more characters as the backspace key was put into
the keyboard buffer.
Fix: To fix this I made a special case for backspace which would remove the previous character in the buffer and decrement the keyboard index 
variable.

Bugs for CP3

Bug # 13 - Aryan, syscall linkage
Problem: We had this error in which when typing ls, the value of EBX (our first arg) would always end up at 98 when calling read for the first file,
thereby making the value of fd also 98
Fix: Had to also include an 'sti' instruction to set the interrupt flag

Bug # 14 - Pranav, syscall linkage
Problem: We were getting a page fault when a negative system call number was passed in
Fix: Changed equal to zero check to less than or equal to zero check

Bug # 15 - Pranav, stdin, stdout
Problem: We were getting issues with stdin and stdout not working
Fix: Changed it so stdin is only accessed by read and stdout is only accessed by write

Bugs for CP4

Bug # 16 - Pranav, cat
Problem: For verylargetextwithverylongname.txt, the filename would overwrite the args causing them to be empty
Fix: Had to include a check to make sure only 32 chars were written

Bug # 17 - Pranav, cat
Problem: For cat, only the first line would be printed to the screen
Fix: Removed a check in terminal write for a newline char

Bug # 18 - Pranav, cat
Problem: For ELF files, the full file would not print
Fix: Changed the while loop logic to be simpler and added an if statement to check for null chars

Bug # 19 - Aryan and Kushal, vidmap
Problem: We kept getting the "abnormal" error when trying to execute fish
Fix: Read through the documentation and recalculated the ending address (upper end of our invalid location check)

Bug # 20 - Aryan, vidmap
Problem: Compiler warnings for comparison and differing in signedness 
Fix: Using the correct unsingned integer bit value, and proper pointer args since screen_start was a double pointer

Bugs for CP5

Bug # 21 - Pranav, num_shells
Problem: Unlimited shells able to be created which caused page faults
Fix: Added a check to limit number of shells created initially to 3

Bug # 22 - Pranav, num_processes
Problem: Unlimited processes able to be created which caused page faults
Fix: Added a check to limit number of processes to 6 (including 3 terminals)

Bug # 23 - Pranav, screen flickering
Problem: Screen flickering when changing terminals
Fix: Added cli, sti to terminal_write
